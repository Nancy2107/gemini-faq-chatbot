    "question": "What should I expect if I become the subject of an OSI investigation?",
    "answer": "The New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment (SCR) is responsible for screening, accepting and assigning reports of suspected child abuse and maltreatment to local jurisdictions for investigation. These include reports made against foster parents concerning children residing in their home, their own children, any children in their custody, any foster children, and any children receiving day care in their home.The New York City Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) Office of Special Investigations (OSI) is responsible for investigating SCR reports received against foster parents living in the five boroughs of New York City. Upon receiving an SCR report, OSI staff conduct a comprehensive child protective investigation, which includes interviewing and meeting with the foster parent and all other adults in the household; meeting with the foster children and all other children including the foster parent’s children residing in the foster home; speaking with the assigned foster care agency and case planner; speaking with collateral contacts who have information about the family and the child, including health care providers, schools, babysitters, neighbors, etc. A Notice of Existence letter will be provided to the foster parent which informs him/her in writing about an investigation. A separate letter will be sent to the foster care agency notifying them that a report has been made. Until the investigation is concluded, additional children will not be placed in your home. Sometimes a formal investigation is not created by the SCR; rather they will create an Additional Information stage and OSI will make an assessment to determine if an investigation or services are needed. OSI Staff will not disclose the source of the SCR report to anyone during the course of the investigation. The investigative process may require that the foster parent and foster children participate in Family Team Conferences and/or Child Safety Conferences with OSI staff and staff from the foster care agency. The investigation will be completed within 60 days and a determination will be made either indicating the case (substantiating the allegations in the SCR report) or unfounding (unsubstantiating the allegations in the SCR report). Upon completion of the investigation, there may be case specific corrective actions required of you and/or the foster care agency to support the safety, well-being and permanency of the foster child(ren) and your own child(ren). There may also be a recommendation that your foster home be closed.If at any time you have questions or need clarification about the allegations and investigation, please contact the assigned OSI CPS staff member or OSI supervisor."

  {
    "question": "Will the foster care agency let me know beforehand that an OSI investigation will be conducted?",
    "answer": "No. In most cases, OSI staff will initiate the investigation by making an unannounced visit to the foster home. The investigation will also include an interview with the assigned case planner from the foster care agency. OSI and the case planner will discuss the allegations and any identified concerns."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I have someone with me for support during an OSI investigation?",
    "answer": "Yes. At any point in an OSI investigation, including the initial unannounced home visit by OSI staff, you may have personal supports with you as long as they do not hinder or obstruct the investigation. These supports may include a foster parent advocate, relatives, friends, neighbors, religious advisors, community partners, or any other appropriate support person. OSI will be speaking to your case planner during an investigation. During the course of fostering children it is important that you speak regularly with your case planner and keep him/her informed about the various things that are happening with your foster child and with you as a foster parent. This will provide an opportunity for the case planner to provide guidance when needed. Situations do not need to rise to the level of an emergency to be shared with your case planner. It is also good to document events in your home related to your foster child in a journal or in a log. This will enable you to remember circumstances and events in more detail should you be asked about them as part of an investigation or inquiry."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can my foster child be removed from my home before the OSI investigation is completed?",
    "answer": "Yes, foster children may be removed at any point during the OSI investigation if the health, well- being, or safety of the child requires it. The foster care agency can also remove and replace foster children as necessary before and during OSI investigations. Planned removals are to take place when health, well-being and safety concerns are not immediate. You must receive written notification of the foster care agency’s planned intent to remove a foster child, except for removals due to a court order. Written notification must be given at least 10 days prior to the proposed effective date of the planned removal. When the health, well-being or safety of the child requires that the child be removed immediately from the foster family home, then this is not considered a planned removal but an emergency removal. In these emergency removal situations, written notice should be given at the time of the removal or as soon as is practicable thereafter. If you disagree with the removal or the proposed removal, you may request a meeting with the foster care agency and/or a Placement Preservation conference. You may also request an Independent Review from ACS. If there is an active investigation with OSI (or if one was closed within 30 days), you may contact the OSI Foster Boarding Home Review team at 212-442-7214 or 212-442-7235. If there is no active OSI investigation (or one was closed greater than 30 days), then contact the ACS Office of Advocacy at 212-676-9421. You may bring a representative to the Independent Review, but you are not required to do so. Your foster care agency case planner will attend the conference. The child’s attorney may attend the conference or present a position in writing to be shared at the conference. If your representative is an attorney, the other parties may also have legal representation. Please inform the Independent Reviewer if you plan to bring an attorney. At the conference, you may discuss the reason for the removal, state why the child(ren) should not be removed or should not have been removed, and have the action reviewed. If the result of the Independent Review concurs with the removal decision, you may seek an appeal by requesting a fair hearing from the New York State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS). It is important to note that a Fair Hearing will not be scheduled by OCFS until an Independent Review has taken place. The information on how to request an appeal is included in the written decision completed by the Independent Reviewer and is also provided below. To request a fair hearing, you may write to: New York State Office of Children and Family Services Bureau of Special Hearings P.O. Box 1930 Albany, New York 12201 Please include the following information when you request a fair hearing: • Applicant’s (foster parent) name, address and telephone number • Name and date of birth of child(ren) removed • Name and address of agency that removed the child • If known, the name and telephone number of the OSI or provider agency supervisor or caseworker that removed the child. If you request a fair hearing, you have a right to examine your case record to the extent that the case record is not confidential. Within this request you may also ask for copies of any part of the case record that you wish to present at the hearing, at no cost to you. At the fair hearing, you will have the right to be represented by an attorney, by a friend or relative, or you may represent yourself. You will have the right to bring witnesses, to ask questions, and to present written and oral evidence. The foster care agency and ACS must comply with the decision issued after the fair hearing as long as it does not conflict with an existing court order."

  {
    "question": "Can my own child(ren) be removed from my home as a result of the OSI investigation concerning my foster child?",
    "answer": "Yes. A second report may be called in against you as it concerns your own children. The OSI caseworker will only remove your children when there is imminent danger to the child’s life or health or when a judge orders it. The OSI caseworker will first attempt to obtain a removal order from a Family Court judge, except where immediate removal is necessary to protect a child’s life or health. The Family Court must balance the risk of harm to the child caused by a removal against the harm the child is likely to experience if left in the care of the parent, and determine which course is in the child’s best interests. Therefore, whenever a removal is being considered, the OSI team will decide whether the child can remain safely at home with the parent while the OSI caseworker requests a Child Safety Conference and thereafter a removal order from the Family Court, or if an Emergency Removal without a court order is required."

  {
    "question": "After the OSI Investigation has begun, can the foster care agency discuss the pending allegations, the investigation and other case work matters with me?",
    "answer": "Yes. Once the OSI investigation has begun, the foster care agency can discuss the pending allegations with you. Your agency can serve as a support to you and your foster child throughout the investigative process. You should also continuously update your agency on what is happening as part of the OSI investigation. OSI will inform the foster care agency that a report has been made against you and will be in discussion with the case planner about the presenting situation, the care of the children, and your abilities as a foster parent."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I want to get an update on the status of the investigation, can I call OSI?",
    "answer": "Yes. You can contact the assigned OSI staff or supervisor to obtain any additional information regarding the investigation, as well as to provide them with information that you may have."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will I be able to have additional foster children placed into my home while the OSI investigation is pending?",
    "answer": "No. Once the OSI investigative process is initiated, your foster home will be placed on hold and no additional foster children will be placed in your home until the investigation is concluded and any corrective action recommendations have been implemented."
  },  
  {
    "question": "What happens after the OSI staff indicates or unfounds the allegations that have been made against me in the SCR report?",
    "answer": "Upon completion of the case investigation, OSI must determine whether there was some credible evidence found during the course of the investigation to substantiate the alleged abuse or maltreatment took place. If there is such evidence, the case will be indicated (allegations substantiated) against you. If there is no credible evidence found, then the case will be unfounded against you. The specific decisions that can be made are as follows: ACS will notify you if your case is indicated. If your case is indicated, it can result in the foster children being removed from your home, if they have not been removed already. An indication can also result in your foster home being closed with a recommendation that it not be reopened. If your case is unfounded, you will receive notice from OCFS. Regardless of the determination made on the case, OSI may request additional actions be completed in the form of a “Corrective Action Plan,” which may or may not allow the foster children to remain with you. This plan will be sent to your agency and your case planner will follow-up with you directly in order to address the additional actions identified by OSI. Depending on the situation, even if the allegations are unfounded, your home may be closed to foster children."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I do if the OSI investigation is indicated against me?",
    "answer": "You have the right to request the decision made by OSI be amended and sealed. The instructions on how to appeal the determination are on the Notice of Indication that you will receive from ACS/OSI about the substantiated allegations. Once OCFS receives your request, an administrative review will be completed by OCFS. If that review sustains (agrees with) OSI’s determination then a fair hearing will automatically be scheduled by OCFS. If neither an administrative review or a fair hearing overturns the OSI determination then the indicated/substantiated case is expunged from the system once the youngest child named in the report is 28 years old. If your foster home was closed and if the administrative review overturns the OSI determination, then your home may still remain closed."
  },
  {
    "question": "If the case is indicated against me and I successfully complete my Corrective Action Plan, may I still be a foster parent?",
    "answer": "Based on the investigation and Corrective Action Plan, a decision will be made to keep your home open to foster children or to close it. While OSI will make a determination if the home is to be closed, the foster care agency may opt to close the home sooner. Whether or not the case is indicated, if OSI and/or the foster care agency recommend closure of your foster home you will not be allowed to foster children in your home. If the decision is to keep your home open and if the corrective action plan is satisfactorily completed, as determined by the Corrective Action Monitoring Unit (CAMU), then you may continue to foster children."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can the foster care agency decide to close my home whether the case is unfounded or indicated against me? If so, why would it be done?",
    "answer": "Yes. All foster homes must meet the standard of care to ensure the safety, health and well-being of all foster children regardless of a case being indicated or unfounded. The foster care agency and/or OSI has the discretion to close your home based on an assessment of your ability to ensure the safety, health and well-being of the foster child(ren) residing in your home. The foster care agency will discuss with you any decision to close your foster home."
  },
  {
    "question": "What can I do if I believe that a false allegation has been made against me to the SCR?",
    "answer": "If you believe that false allegations have been made against you to the SCR, please inform the OSI caseworker assigned to investigate the case and state the basis for your belief. The OSI staff can submit an inquiry request to the ACS Criminal Justice Coordinator to look into the allegations further. The Criminal Justice Coordinator will assess whether the SCR report(s) in question constitutes a false report of an incident. If the case is determined to be false and meets the District Attorney Office’s criteria, the Criminal Justice Coordinator will refer the matter to the appropriate District Attorney’s Office."
  },
  {
    "question": "My OSI case was unfounded. Why is it still coming up on my SCR clearance?",
    "answer": "If your case is unfounded, it is sealed and by state law will remain on file with the SCR for 10 years from the date that the SCR received the report. However, if your case is unfounded and you are named in subsequent reports, ACS can access the prior unfounded case. After 10 years any unfounded cases will be automatically removed from NYS Office of Children and Family (OCFS) records."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a Juvenile Delinquent, a Juvenile Offender and an Adolescent Offender?",
    "answer": "A Juvenile Delinquent is a youth between ages 12 and 15 who has committed an offense. 16 and 17 year old youth charged with all misdemeanors or felonies that have been removed from Criminal/Supreme Court are also considered Juvenile Delinquents. All juvenile delinquency cases are heard in Family Court. A youth who is 13, 14 or 15 years old and has committed a very serious felony, may be tried as a Juvenile Offender in the New York City Supreme Court. If found guilty, the youth is subject to more serious penalties than a Juvenile Delinquent. Juvenile offender charges can be removed to Family Court.An Adolescent Offender is a 16 or 17-year-old youth charged with a felony that has been retained in the Youth Part."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does my child go when he/she is arrested?",
    "answer": "If your child is arrested as a juvenile delinquent, the Police Officer may process the case in a few different ways. The Police may do one of the following:1. Release your child to you. 2. Release your child with a Family Court Appearance Ticket (directing your child to report to court on a certain date). 3. Bring your child directly to the Family Court, if the Court is open, or to the Criminal Court. 4. Bring your child to an ACS detention center, if the Family Court is closed. Your child may be seen by Probation and be released to you, or your child may stay in detention and be transported to court on the next court day. If your child is arrested as a juvenile offender or an adolescent offender, your child will be brought from the precinct to Criminal Court for arraignment."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after my child is arrested as a Juvenile Delinquent?",
    "answer": "The New York City Department of Probation (DOP) conducts an interview with the child, the family, the Police Officer, and the victim. Based on the interviews, the probation officer may refer the case to the New York City Law Department for prosecution in the Family Court.Instead of referring the case to the Law Department, the Probation Officer may “adjust” the case. This means that DOP will send the child home and monitor him or her for up to 60 days. If the child follows all the rules and conditions, the case would end without Family Court involvement. However, if the child is not complying with DOP supervision, the Probation Officer will refer the case to the Law Department which has discretion to file a juvenile delinquency petition in Family Court."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does my child need a lawyer?",
    "answer": "New York City provides lawyers free of cost to individuals who are prosecuted in Family and Criminal Court and who cannot afford to pay."
  },
  {
    "question": "While the court case is pending, does my child get to come home?",
    "answer": "The Judge decides where the child should go for the duration of the court case at the initial court appearance. The Judge can order your child to an ACS detention facility, or allow your child to return home with you with or without conditions. Other options may be discussed in court. When sending a child home, the judge can place the child under the supervision of Probation or require participation an alternative-to-detention program."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a fact-finding hearing/trial?",
    "answer": "A fact-finding hearing takes place in Family Court for youth charged as Juvenile Delinquents, and is similar to a criminal trial in the adult Court system. The Judge hears evidence to determine whether the child committed the charged offense. If the Court finds that the child committed the offense, it will schedule a dispositional hearing to determine whether the child is in need of probation supervision, treatment, or placement. Youth charged as Juvenile Offenders and Adolescent Offenders have their cases processed in the Youth Part of Supreme Court. A trial is the process where evidence is presented and a determination is made by a judge or jury as to the guilt or innocence of the youth charged."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens at the dispositional hearing/sentencing?",
    "answer": "The dispositional hearing occurs in Family Court after the court makes a finding against a juvenile delinquent and is similar to the sentencing hearing in the adult system. The Judge receives evidence about the youth's history, behavior, and progress. The Court may order a Mental Health Study if the Judge feels that information will be helpful in determining the disposition of the case. Parents and other people with information helpful to the Court may also testify. Based on the testimonies and any supporting documents, the Court decides which option would best meet the needs of the youth and the safety of the community. The Court has the following options: 1. Send the youth home without Court supervision, but with certain conditions set by the Court, which is called a conditional discharge. 2. Send the youth home under Probation supervision. 3. Send the youth home and put him or her in an alternative-to-placement program. 4. Place the youth in a Close to Home placement facility. In the Youth Parts, the judge announces the sentence at the end of sentencing proceedings for juvenile offenders and adolescent offenders. Determinations as to whether a young person will be adjudicated a youthful offender happen at sentence. A judge can sentence a young person to a period of incarceration which will be served in facilities administered by the Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) until the youth's 21st birthday, with any additional time to be served in the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). A sentence of a year or less can be served in an ACS facility if ordered by the judge. A court can also sentence a youth to probation or a conditional discharge."

    "answer": "Your child is expected to follow the rules and conditions of the program and the Probation Officer.
